# eggshell

eggshell brings OpenAI's GPT-4 to your CLI. GPT-4 will generate valid shell commands from your natural language input, thus saving lots of googling and browsing on stack overflow. And the best: You can use the AI capabilites directly from your shell, making the usage VERY easy.

# Examples

```
chegger:~$ q What time is it?
chegger:~$ date +%T
22:39:38
```

```
chegger:~$ q What is the weather like in Vienna?
chegger:~$ curl "wttr.in/Vienna?format=%C+%t"
Clear +22Â°C
```

# Usage

As seen above you can simply call the eggshell script by using the `q` command on your CLI. Thus you can use your CLI the way you are used to and in addition you can use the `q` command to let GPT-4 generate a shell command for your query. Check out the examples to get a feeling for it.

Eggshell is set up to record all of your shell sessions (both input and output) and adds this session as context for your natural language queries. This way, GPT-4 generates tailored commands that solve your specific problem very reliably.

## Special commands

`q -c`: Clears the current session. This has two important implications:
1. GPT-4 "forgets" what has happened up to this point in the sesison. Thus, it cannot access any information from the past up to this point in time.
2. This means that fewer tokens are sent to GPT-4. Can decrease token usage a LOT when used frequently, thus drastically increasing speed and decreasing costs when querying GPT-4.
